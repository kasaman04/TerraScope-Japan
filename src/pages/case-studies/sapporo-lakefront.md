## Client Goal

The buyer, a Hong Kong-based real estate developer, wanted to build **six eco-cabins** overlooking Lake Shikotsu, targeting the growing sustainable tourism market in Hokkaido. However, they were unsure about flood zoning regulations and building height restrictions that could impact their development plans.

The property appeared perfect from satellite imagery, but the client needed comprehensive due diligence before committing to the ¬•27 million asking price.

## Our Approach

<MetricBadges list={frontmatter.metrics} />

Our team deployed a comprehensive three-pronged assessment strategy:

### 1. Floodplain Analysis
Using the newest MLIT 1-meter mesh Digital Elevation Model (DEM), we identified that 15% of the property fell within a 50-year flood zone. This discovery was crucial as it wasn't clearly marked in the original property listing.

### 2. Legal Zone Assessment
The plot straddled a quasi-national park boundary requiring a 5-meter setback from the lake edge. This restriction would reduce the buildable area by approximately 20% and limit the height of structures to 10 meters.

### 3. Drone 360¬∞ Survey
Our comprehensive aerial survey revealed optimal positioning for lake view corridors and identified the best locations for eco-cabin placement while maintaining environmental compliance.

## Key Findings

The assessment revealed several critical issues:

- **Flood Risk**: 15% of property in flood zone requiring elevated construction
- **Setback Requirements**: 5m buffer from lake edge reduced buildable area
- **Height Restrictions**: 10m maximum building height in protected zone
- **Soil Conditions**: Rocky substrate requiring specialized foundation work

## Outcome

### Price Negotiation Success
Armed with our detailed risk assessment, the client successfully negotiated a **12% discount** (¬•3.2 M reduction) due to the additional flood mitigation costs and reduced buildable area.

### Financing Approval
The client's bank approved the reduced financing amount with our comprehensive report as supporting documentation, streamlining the approval process.

### Construction Success
Construction permits were granted in April 2025, with the eco-lodge design optimized based on our recommendations. The project is now on track to open in summer 2025.
